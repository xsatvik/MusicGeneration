# Music Generation with LSTM

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to generate music. The project consists of several key scripts for preprocessing music data, training the LSTM model, and generating new music.

## Project Structure

- `preprocess.py`: Contains functions and methods for preprocessing the music data.
- `train.py`: Contains the code for training the LSTM model.
- `melodygenerator.py`: Contains the code for generating new music based on the trained model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Music21

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy music21
```

## Usage

### Preprocessing the Data

To preprocess your music data, run:
```bash
python preprocess.py
```
This script will convert your raw music files into a format suitable for training the LSTM model.

### Training the Model

To train the LSTM model, run:
```bash
python train.py
```
This will train the model on the preprocessed music data. Make sure you have enough computational resources as training deep learning models can be resource-intensive.

### Generating Music

To generate new music, run:
```bash
python melodygenerator.py
```
This script will use the trained LSTM model to generate new music based on a seed sequence.

## Adding Seed Music

You can add your seed music data in the `melodygenerator.py` script. The seed music is used as the initial input to the LSTM model for generating new music.
